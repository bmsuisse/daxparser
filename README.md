# DAX Parser (actually a Lexer only :) )

Utility to parse dax. Very minimal API yet, currently exposes a `get_columns_or_measures` to get all columns/measures used by a dax statement

Based on TabularEditor2's Dax Lexer: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TabularEditor/TabularEditor/master/AntlrGrammars/DAXLexer.g4
